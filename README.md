Decision-Tree-and-Ensemble-Models
The aim of the project was to implement Multiclass Classification on the Cars Data , which classifies the car into classes such as ("acc", 'good', 'unacc', 'vgood')

In this project different Machine Learning Models (Listed below) were used for the prediction of classes.

The data was in .csv format consisting of independent attributes such as ('buying','maint','doors','persons','lug_boot','safety') and dependent variable ('classes')

The project consisted of following stages:-

 -->Importing dependencies
 
 -->Importing data
 
 -->Preprocessing Data
 
 -->Splitting the Data in Train and Test Data
 
 -->Training the data on different Models
 
 -->Prediction of individual models
 
 -->Evaluating the models
